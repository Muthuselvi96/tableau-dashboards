**How I Effectively Used Dashboards as a Product- Data Analyst**
As a Product Analyst, I used interactive dashboards to transform complex telecom customer data into clear, actionable insights. By leveraging tools like [mention your tool, e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or Python Dash], I was able to:

Monitor key churn indicators such as monthly charges, contract types, and customer service interactions in real-time

Identify patterns and risk factors driving customer churn, enabling targeted retention strategies

Visualize customer segments based on behavior, demographics, and plan preferences

Effectively communicate insights to cross-functional teams and leadership through intuitive visualizations

Track the impact of changes to pricing, plans, or service quality over time

These dashboards helped me go beyond static reporting â€” I was able to support fast, data-driven decisions that directly contributed to improving customer retention and product performance.
